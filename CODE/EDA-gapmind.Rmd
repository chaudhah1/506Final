## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

##Import the dataset from the csv file 
```{r}
gapminder <-read.csv("gapminder.csv")

```

##Data Description
##The data consists of 41284 observations and 6 Variables
##There are 4 numerical variables and the other two are categorical namely, country and region.
##Understanding and summary of the data
```{r}
str(gapminder)
summary(gapminder)

```
##The data ranges from the year 1800 to 2015 
##The minimum life expectancy is 1 maximum is 84 and the median is 35.40 
##The minimum income is 142 and the maximum is 182668 and the median is 1450
##The data includes mostly data from countries in Europe & central asia region or Sub-Saharan African region. 

#The questions we would like to explore using EDA for this data set are:
### > 1 what is the median income of all countries individually?
### > 2 What is the mean life expectancy in all of the regions
### > 3 what is the relationship between income and life expectancy?
### > 4 What is the relationship between region and life expectancy?
### > 4 What does the growth look like in terms of income from the year 1800 to 2000's? 
### > 5 What does the income look like in a median life expectancy?
### > 6 For the year 2001 what is the median life expectancy of the people in each country? 
### > 7 Graphic representation of the life expectancy in different regions.

###Uploading and activating all the libraries that we will use.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(forcats)
library(gridExtra)
library(caret)
require(data.table)
library(corrplot)

```

##Inspecting for missing values 
```{r}
gapminder <-na.omit(gapminder)
```

##Sorting data for two countries that we will be analyzing further
##We are now filter by country name, namely- Afghanistan & Malaysia 
```{r}
gapminder %>%
  filter(Country =="Afghanistan")
gapminder %>% 
  filter(Country =="Malaysia")

```
###### Exploratory Data Analysis to answer all the question framed for the dataset ########

## > 1 What is the median income of all the countries. 
```{r}
aggregate(income ~ Country,gapminder,median)
```

## > 2 What is the mean life expectancy in the region. 
```{r}
aggregate(life ~ region,gapminder,mean)
```
## > 3 Graph showing relationship between income and life
```{r}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = income, y = life)) + geom_point()
```
## >4 Graph showing relationship between region and life

```{r}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = region, y = life)) + geom_point()
```
## > 4 What is growth income in all regions from the year 1800 to 2000's 

```{r}
gapminder  %>%  
  group_by(Year) %>% 
  summarize(income = median(income)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = income)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  expand_limits(y = 0)
```
## > 5 Whats is the relationship between median life and income?

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  group_by(income) %>% 
  summarize(life = median(life)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = income, y = life)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  expand_limits(y = 0)
```


## > 6 For the year 2001 what is the median life expectancy of the people in each country.
```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(Year == 2001) %>% 
  group_by(Country) %>%
summarise(life =median(life))
```


## > 7 Graphic representation of the life expectancy in different regions
```{r}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = region, y = life)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.colour = "hotpink") +
  geom_jitter(position = position_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0), alpha = 1/4)
```


## Including Plots
```{r}

```
You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
